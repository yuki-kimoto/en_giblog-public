<h3> What can I ask in the Giblog forum? </H3>
<p>
  The Giblog forum is currently preparing the following channels. A channel is a theme, isn't it? Ask questions on the channel that suits your purpose. If you don't know, ask a question in the "chat room". "Where should I write this question?" (Example)
</p>
<h4> Miscellaneous room </h4>
<p>
  This is a channel that members of the Giblog forum can write freely.
</p>
<h4> Installation </h4>
<p>
  If you have any questions about installing Giblog, you can ask here.
</p>
<p>
  Giblog <a href="/blog/20190826074335.html"> supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS</a>. If you can't install Perl or Giblog, ask a question here.
</p>
<h4> How to use git </h4>
<p>
  Giblog can <a href="/blog/20190809083515.html"> manage all pages with Git</a>, but if you don't know how to use Git, ask here.
</p>
<p>
  You need to know how to use Linux to some extent as a prerequisite for git, but questions about that are also OK here.
</p>
<h4> Design theme </h4>
<p>
  You can ask questions about design themes such as HTML and CSS here. If you want to redesign your site but don't know how to do it, ask here.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/blog/20190819080050.html"> Smartphone support</a> may not be understood, <a href="/blog/20190816080249.html"> SEO measures</a>, etc. Questions are also OK.
</p>
<h4> Customize </h4>
<p>
  If you want to <a href="/blog/20190827080034.html"> customize your Giblog for your own site</a>, you can ask here.
</p>
<p>
  You can ask questions about customizing Giblog, such as wanting to set up a Twitter card or how to write in markdown.
</p>
<p>
  You can also ask the <a href="https://perlzemi.com/"> Perl</a> itself questions needed for customization here.
</p>
<p>
  If you have a question about creating a <a href="/blog/20190820075913.html"> inquiry form</a>, you can also click here.
</p>
<h4> Publishing the site </h4>
<p>
  Gitblog explains how to use <a href="/blog/20190828064434.html"> Gihub Pages</a> as a simple and free way to publish your site.
</p>
<p>
  Here you can ask questions about publishing your site, such as how to publish your Giblog website on a rental server, how to get a domain, how to set up SSL, and more.
</p>
<h4> Site promotion </h4>
<p>
  Sites created with Giblog can be made known to forum members here. If you want to know your site, write a brief description of your site here and promote it.
</p>
<p>
  Sites that are offensive to public order and morals, violent sites, or sexual sites are write-protected.
</p>
<h4> Bug report </h4>
<p>
  You can report bugs in Giblog itself here.
</p>
<h4> Developer </h4>
